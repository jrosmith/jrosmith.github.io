                I am a web developer with experience in Ruby, Rails,
                JavaScript, and React. A full list of my skills, as well
                as recent projects, can be found by selecting the
                corresponding tabs in the nav bar. Recent projects of mine
                include BlandCramp, a music sharing app inspired by BandCamp
                and built on Ruby on Rails with a JS/React front end, and
                FastApp, a web app framework inspired by Ruby on Rails and
                Active Record and designed to provide a platform for beginners to learn
                the basics of building Full-Stack web applications.

                In addition to web development, I have an extensive
                background in physics, physics education, and physics
                education research. In my spare time I enjoy spoiling my
                bluetick coonhound, shooting pool, and playing music.
